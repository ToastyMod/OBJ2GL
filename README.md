# OBJ2GL
A python script that hardcodes OBJ models to OpenGL

# TODO
- More languages (WebGL, you're next)
- Make it write data to arrays and specify the data format in VBO calls
- Create a C++ class that manages multiple 3D models
- Auto-write and auto-update a working header file that includes those 3D model classes
